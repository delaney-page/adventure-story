...[continued from whatever branch the reader was previously on]

As the sub makes its way out of the cave and begins to approach the surface of the water, our heroes, thinking they are safe, prepare to return to the beach.\\

"This isn't Dover!!" exclaims Paul as they watch the Spanish Armada floating past them, "at least not the one I know, the cliffs are too white."\\

"They must think we're proper British, they must want to kill us!!!!" shouts George.\\

"Why don't we tell them we can be their mistrels if they let us go!" suggests John.\\

Suddenly, a white bolt of fire begins to arc towards them, searing the very sky on its path to the doomed sailors.\\

So it goes.

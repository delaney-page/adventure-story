John, Paul, Ringo, and George all decided to go on a yellow submarine one day.
They arrive at the harbor with packed peanut butter and jelly sandwiches,
their submarine licenses, and a sense of adventure.
They all climb in, ready to explore the murky waters of the English Channel.
However, they know something that most seafaring people don’t.
There is a secret place in the deep depths that contains a teeming environment
filled with octopi, merpeople, and brightly colored coral.
The quad submerges into the icy waters. Ringo, as he is usually always hungry,
begins munching on his sandwich as Paul and John begin bickering about how to
get to the secret location…\\

Soon it becomes too dark to see anything in the water, but our heroes are too busy arguing to notice.\\

Suddenly, something heavy seems to hit against the side of the sub, startling John, Paul, Ringo, and George into awareness.\\

"What was that?" asks George in a tremulous voice.\\

"Well why don't we find out?" says Ringo nonchalantly as he flips on the sub's external lights.\\

As our heroes squint through the murky darkness penetrated only minimally by the glare, they see a sunken shipyard to their right, but a cave ripe for exploring to their left.\\

Which path will they take? Will they live to write the White Album? Choose the shipyard branch to follow them into a graveyard of discarded hulls, or the cave branch if you are brave enough to witness the pits of darkness......\\

So you have decided to venture into the haunted shipyard...\\

The fearsome foursome edge their way around the empty husks of once grand ocean liners, taking care not to disturb the sleeping metallic ghosts.\\

Suddenly, out of nowhere, Aquaman himself, rises from the sand, and strikes his trident against the glass windows of the sub.\\

"Be gone from my ocean you fools," he shouts, "and take your lousy music with you before I smite you."\\

"Let's get out of hereeeeee!!!" shouts Ringo, finally waking up from his nap, "Why don't we head towards that whirlpool?"\\

"That seems like a good idea," says John affirmatively, "Maybe I can write a song about it."\\

As our heroes get sucked into the whirling gyre, they soon lose consciousness from all the spinning.\\

When they wake up, they are back on shore, and so, thinking they are safe, they start to venture out....

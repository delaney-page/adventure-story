John, Paul, Ringo, and George all decided to go on a yellow submarine one day.
They arrive at the harbor with packed peanut butter and jelly sandwiches,
their submarine licenses, and a sense of adventure.
They all climb in, ready to explore the murky waters of the English Channel.
However, they know something that most seafaring people don’t.
There is a secret place in the deep depths that contains a teeming environment
filled with octopi, merpeople, and brightly colored coral.
The quad submerges into the icy waters. Ringo, as he is usually always hungry,
begins munching on his sandwich as Paul and John begin bickering about how to
get to the secret location…\\

They get into the sub, but soon they start to lose consciousness from the noxious fumes in the sub, as they forgot to air out their collected flatulence from their previous trip...\\

When they wake up again, thinking they are safe, they begin to venture out of the sub.\\

"This isn't Dover!!" exclaims Paul as they watch the Spanish Armada floating past them, "at least not the one I know, the cliffs are too white."\\

"They must think we're proper British, they must want to kill us!!!!" shouts George.\\

"Why don't we tell them we can be their mistrels if they let us go!" suggests John.\\

Suddenly, a white bolt of fire begins to arc towards them, searing the very sky on its path to the doomed sailors.\\

So it goes.

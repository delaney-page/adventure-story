John, Paul, Ringo, and George all decided to go on a yellow submarine one day.
They arrive at the harbor with packed peanut butter and jelly sandwiches,
their submarine licenses, and a sense of adventure.
They all climb in, ready to explore the murky waters of the English Channel.
However, they know something that most seafaring people don’t.
There is a secret place in the deep depths that contains a teeming environment
filled with octopi, merpeople, and brightly colored coral.
The quad submerges into the icy waters. Ringo, as he is usually always hungry,
begins munching on his sandwich as Paul and John begin bickering about how to
get to the secret location…\\

Soon it becomes too dark to see anything in the water, but our heroes are too busy arguing to notice.\\

Suddenly, something heavy seems to hit against the side of the sub, startling John, Paul, Ringo, and George into awareness.\\

"What was that?" asks George in a tremulous voice.\\

"Well why don't we find out?" says Ringo nonchalantly as he flips on the sub's external lights.\\

As our heroes squint through the murky darkness penetrated only minimally by the glare, they see a sunken shipyard to their right, but a cave ripe for exploring to their left.\\

Which path will they take? Will they live to write the White Album? Choose the shipyard branch to follow them into a graveyard of discarded hulls, or the cave branch if you are brave enough to witness the pits of darkness......\\

So you have chosen to venture into the cave...\\

Our heroes edge the sub into the gaping maw, stalactites and stalagmites threatening to pierce the hull.\\

As they venture deeper they begin to feel as if they are falling deeper and deeper into the core of the Earth. The temperature starts to rise and the molten glow of the sub brings some light to their surroundings.\\

"Are we dead?" asks Paul, "And does this mean I can finally steal all of our songs?" as he sees a light filtering through underneath the sub.\\

"No," replies John, "I think we just returned to the mouth of the cave".\\

As the sub makes its way out of the cave and begins to approach the surface of the water, our heroes, thinking they are safe, prepare to return to the beach.\\

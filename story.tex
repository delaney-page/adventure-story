...[continued from whatever branch the reader was previously on]

As the sub makes its way out of the cave and begins to approach the surface of the water, our heroes, thinking they are safe, prepare to return to the beach.\\

"This isn't Dover!!" exclaims Paul as they watch the Spanish Armada floating past them, "at least not the one I know, the cliffs are too white."\\

"They must think we're proper British, they must want to kill us!!!!" shouts George.\\

"Why don't we tell them we can be their mistrels if they let us go!" suggests John.\\

Suddenly, a white bolt of fire begins to arc towards them, searing the very sky on its path to the doomed sailors.\\

So it goes.

So you have decided to venture into the haunted shipyard...\\

The fearsome foursome edge their way around the empty husks of once grand ocean liners, taking care not to disturb the sleeping metallic ghosts.\\

Suddenly, out of nowhere, Aquaman himself, rises from the sand, and strikes his trident against the glass windows of the sub.\\

"Be gone from my ocean you fools," he shouts, "and take your lousy music with you before I smite you."\\

"Let's get out of hereeeeee!!!" shouts Ringo, finally waking up from his nap, "Why don't we head towards that whirlpool?"\\

"That seems like a good idea," says John affirmatively, "Maybe I can write a song about it."\\

As our heroes get sucked into the whirling gyre, they soon lose consciousness from all the spinning.\\

When they wake up, they are back on shore, and so, thinking they are safe, they start to venture out....
